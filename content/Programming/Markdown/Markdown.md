> [!hint] Flags and options
> For full help options, you can run `npx quartz sync --help`.
>
> Most of these have sensible defaults but you can override them if you have a custom setup:
>
> - `-d` or `--directory`: the content folder. This is normally just `content`
> - `-v` or `--verbose`: print out extra logging information
> - `--commit` or `--no-commit`: whether to make a `git` commit for your changes
> - `--push` or `--no-push`: whether to push updates to your GitHub fork of Quartz
> - `--pull` or `--no-pull`: whether to try and pull in any updates from your GitHub fork (i.e. from other devices) before pushing
